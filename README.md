Hi, and Welcome to my GitHub profile!
###### In here, you'll find mostly translations that I've contributed and, issues that bother me the most. ✌

## About Me 👨🏻:

- I do know _somewhat_ the basics of the HTML, but that's all the "programming" I know... 👽


- I'm just a Romanian person on GitHub, trying to help open sourceness on here (well, mostly translations...) 🇷🇴


- I don't typically like putting out my age, but, I'm in the range of an adolescence... 👀

##### I still need to improve this page, since it hasn't been updated in a while.
